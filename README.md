# Fractal6
6th iteration of Fractal project

This program allows you to alter any parameters to create your own fractal.
This program can create various fractal forms, including Mandelbrot set fractals, Julia set fractals, Newton fractals, and fractals based on the rules of the collatz conjecture. 
This program can create .png or .gif files
This program is set up to allow a lot of growing room to include more varieties of fractals should you want to add them in the future. It is also set up to allow a lot of customizability when making your own fractal image or animation.
